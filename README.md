# 🧮 Python CLI Calculator

## 📘 Overview
This is a simple command-line calculator built using **Python**.  
It performs basic arithmetic operations — **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division** — using a text-based menu interface.

## ⚙️ Features
- Perform basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Handles division by zero gracefully
- Keeps running until the user chooses to exit
- User-friendly command-line interface
- Error-free integer and float input support

## 🧠 How It Works
The program defines four basic arithmetic functions:
- `add(a, b)` → adds two numbers  
- `subtract(a, b)` → subtracts the second number from the first  
- `multiply(a, b)` → multiplies two numbers  
- `divide(a, b)` → divides the first number by the second (with zero-check)

When the program runs, it displays a menu of operations.  
The user selects an option, enters two numbers, and sees the result instantly.  
It continues until the user selects the "Exit" option.
